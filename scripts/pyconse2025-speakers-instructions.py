    https://pycon.se/#program


* About the presentations

If you represent a company or want to show your company
please use maximum 2 slides for it and no more than 5 minutes.
The conference focus is Python and it shouldn't be used
for advertisement.  So please keep this policy in mind during
your talk.

There is no template and we don't store the presentations.
You can decide whatever template that suits better for your
presentation slides.


* Regarding the presentation technicalities

You can use resolution 1080p for your presentation (1920x1080 px).
We expect to have HDMI and USB-C connector for the equipment, but
we will confirm it on Wednesday.

There will be wifi provided by the venue as well.

We don't store the presentations, so you don't need to send it to
us in advance.  All presentations will be recorded at main 
auditorium.  Videos will be released next year, but we don't
have yet a specific date about it.



* Tips about presenting at the stage

There is no good manual or handbook for that, but we can recommend the
good "how to avoid death by powerpoint" with very clear points how
to make great presentations.
