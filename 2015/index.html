            <h2>Talks</h2>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><a name="berman"></a><h3>Building an Interpreter in RPython</h3><p>Julian Berman</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>RPython is a language and toolchain for building interpreters, most prominently PyPy, a Python interpreter. But RPython is a powerful tool for writing interpreters for many dynamic languages. We'll learn how to write a simple interpreter in RPython by implementing a parser, bytecode compiler and VM for a small language.</p></li>
                <li><a name="pieters"></a><h3>Deep Learning and Deep Data Science</h3><p>Roelof Pieters</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>Deep Learning, anyone who has followed machine learning over the past years has heard it. In this talk I will go past the hype and show what deep learning actually means and how one goes about solving complex machine learning task with a minimum amount of code, with the help of theano, an amazing python library for deep learning. I will show examples from my own research in language and vision, and hope to show that Deep Learning is not only fun, but also not as difficult as one might expect.</p></li>
                <li><a name="reitz"></a><h3>Python for Humans</h3><p>Kenneth Reitz</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>Python’s ecosystem is held up to a high standard, but it falls short in a few key areas. A handful of crucial APIs are an absolute pain to work with. We’ll go over where these APIs went wrong and learn about strong and elegant API design. The high barriers to entry in Python will be discussed. Potential solutions will be proposed.</p></li>
                <li><a name="linderborg"></a><h3>Analyzing data with Pandas</h3><p>Robin Linderborg</p><p>Target audience: Beginners</p><p>A gentle introduction to data analysis and visualization in Python using the Pandas library. We will explore how to clean, restructure, analyze and visualize data sets.</p></li>
                <li><a name="meritz"></a><h3>From Explicitness to Convention: A Journey from Django to Rails</h3><p>Rebecca Meritz</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>I've just switched jobs from writting Django fulltime to writing Rails fulltime. This talk will be a reflection on what I miss from Django and why and what I've gained from Rails.</p></li>
                <li><a name="cano"></a><h3>IPython: how a notebook is changing science</h3><p>Juan Luis Cano</p><p>Target audience: Beginners</p><p>IPython was born as an Interactive Python shell on steroids 14 years ago, but its notebook tool is shaping the way scientists, developers and even journalists communicate and explore science. Let us examine IPython's importance in Open Science now that Nature highlighted one of its awesome features!</p></li>
                <li><a name="ljungmark"></a><h3>Embedded Python in Practice</h3><p>Dennis Ljungmark</p><p>Target audience: Beginners</p><p>We have been using Python in embedded use for several years. The talk will go over pains, pleasures and strategies. The talk will cover: Performance, when it matters and not; Size, memory and other constraints; Python on systems without FPU; What we actually do (SCADA, bus-integrations etc.);</p></li>
                <li><a name="heuer"></a><h3>Hacking Human Language</h3><p>Hendrik Heuer</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>If you convert words into numbers, you can do interesting things with them. You can compare the topics in a book, make better translations and tell if a sentence is positive or negative. Python libraries like gensim and spaCy make it easy to play with this for fun, profit or social science.</p></li>
                <li><a name="white"></a><h3>How to Build a Python Web Application with Flask and Neo4j</h3><p>Nicole White</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>Flask, a popular Python web framework, has many tutorials available online that use an SQL database to store information about the website’s users and their activities. In this session, we’ll use Neo4j instead of SQL to build social aspects into our application, including recommending similar users to the logged-in user.</p></li>
                <li><a name="stenstrom"></a><h3>Why Django Sucks</h3><p>Emil Stenström</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>When you love something very much, you run the risk of losing perspective. This is my chance to take on a more negative view of Django, and talk about its worst parts. I will talk about five problem areas: Async, Components, NoSQL, Isomorphic apps, and Single codebase.</p></li>

                <li><a name="bendebiche"></a><h3>Docker and Python at Spotify</h3><p>Belhorma Bendebiche</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>Docker is a tool that helps containerize, package and run applications in their own isolated environment, greatly simplifying the deployment process.This talk is about how we containerized some of our Python services at Spotify, the challenges faced and how we solved them.</p></li>
                <li><a name="temian"></a><h3>GitFs - Building a Filesystem in Python</h3><p>Vlad Temian</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>GitFs is an open-source filesystem which was designed to bring the full powers of Git to everyone, no matter how little they know about versioning. In this talk we will take a look at some of the crucial aspects involved in building a reliable FUSE filesystem, the steps that we took in building GitFs, especially in handling the git objects, what testing methods we have used for it and also we will share the most important lessons learned while building it.
                <li><a name="amir"></a><h3>Ship Python Apps with Docker!</h3><p>Rasheed Amir</p><p>Target audience: Beginners</p><p>Docker allows to create lightweight, portable & self-sufficient containers. My presentation will have two parts: (1) First I'll give a brief introduction about docker & (2) then I'll build a docker image for a simple python app and then deploy it to my own computer, EC2, and Google cloud engine.</p></li>

                <li><a name="nilsson"></a><h3>U2F: Phishing-proof two-factor authentication for everyone</h3><p>Dain Nilsson</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>Today's dominating two-factor authentication standard was invented long before the web; it's not secure nor usable enough. This led a group of IT-giants to develop the U2F open standard. We'll start by showing U2F in action, explain how it works and why it's needed, then add U2F to a Django application.</p></li>
                <li><a name="sluijters"></a><h3>Puppet and Python</h3><p>Daniele Sluijters</p><p>Target audience: Advanced users</p><p>Building tooling around Puppet, but in Python! People forget that even though a tool like Puppet is written in Ruby or PuppetDB in Clojure, as long as we have an API to talk to we can build anything we need by layering in some Python.</p></li>
