			Everyone likes to be selected for a cool opportunity. A company that pays well and covers reallocation,
			a competition that gives scholarship or that incredible project that just cheers you up. But finding
			these opportunities is another story: it requires A LOT OF TIME checking several webpages. If you are
			the type of person who likes to work smarter than harder, come with me in this workshop to learn how
			to build a web scraper with Python that makes opportunities fall into your lap!
