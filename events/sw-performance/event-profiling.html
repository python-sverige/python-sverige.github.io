		<h2>Profiling Python by Example</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Abstract: </b>Occasionally we’ll find that some bit of Python we’ve written doesn’t run as fast as we’d like, yet,
			many aspiring programmers are oftentimes unfamiliar with principled techniques to identify performance
			bottlenecks in their code.
			In this tutorial, I will first describe the Python performance analysis ecosystem with broad strokes,
			and then turn to interactive demonstrations to showcase the most prominent tools of trade on a real
			practical problem.
